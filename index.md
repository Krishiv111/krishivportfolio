- Here is a picture with me and my poster at teh San Diego Super Computer Center final showcase where I showcased my project and summer reaserch to many different researchers and mentors.


## Summary

- This was an internship I completed at the UCSD Center for Supercomputing during the summer of 2024. I worked on solving issues for researchers who encountered difficulties running their large data-based applications. Using applications like Wasmer and Emscripten, I developed a process to run large data sets. Since Wasmer had limited documentation on downloading and installing, it took me weeks to figure out my approach. Through an EC2 cloud instance, I broke down commands, tested uploading large files within the cloud, and ran them locally. I found that using commands to convert these files between programming languages allowed me to run them effectively.

- Here is the documentation I created during my initial weeks.
