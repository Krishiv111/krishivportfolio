<p>Here is a picture with me and my poster at the San Diego Super Computer Center final showcase, where I showcased my project and summer research to many different researchers and mentors.</p>

<h2>Project Summary and Details</h2>
<p>This was an internship I completed at the UCSD Center for Supercomputing during the summer of 2024. I worked on solving issues for researchers who encountered difficulties running their large data-based applications. Using applications like Wasmer and Emscripten, I developed a process to run large data sets.</p>
<p>Since Wasmer had limited documentation on downloading and installing, it took me weeks to figure out my approach. Through an EC2 cloud instance, I broke down commands, tested uploading large files within the cloud, and ran them locally. I found that using commands to convert these files between programming languages allowed me to run them effectively.</p>

<p>Here is the documentation I created during my initial weeks:</p>

<h1 id="project2">Project #2: Data Sorting Project</h1>
<h2>Project Summary and Details</h2>
<p>Here is a data sorting project I collaborated with in MY APCSA Class, although the school funded aws server doesn't work anymore so our frontend data isn't able to fetch the backend on something other than a local source I linked a github issues with the teams contributions and my team video; an important note is my key contributions are highlighted within the first part of the video. However the purpose of this project was to visualize time complexity through different sort methods (bubble,heap,merge,etc), my team decided to create a  full stack project with api's to see if a large sum of data was fetched how long it would take to be sorted. In addition to visualize a sort we used sort of like a battery ( the green bar) to see how quickly each sort method could charge our battery up. This project helped me grasp the fundamentals on how to program sort methods. Additionally it allowed me to dive into data science topics by fetching api's, cleaning and error correcting data, and use AWS cloud server to deploy a site. This project was built up of a backend on Java Spring with use of controller files and inheritance for sorting methods to be fetched based on user input. For the frontend, github pages was used to create the user input. Overall I had a lot of fun making this project, as it helped me strengthen my technical and collaboration skills.</p>
